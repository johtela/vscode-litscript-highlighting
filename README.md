# Syntax Highlighting for LiTScript

[LiTScript][] is a literate programming tool that creates documentation from 
code comments. You can add documentation to many kinds of files including TS,
CSS, Less, Scss, and JSON. This extension higlights markdown text in JSDoc
comments for all of the supported file formats. It distinguishes most of the
markdown elements such as headings, inlines, lists, and so forth.
